# Welcome to yuekai's wiki - BMCU wiki

You can contact me by
Reddit : [u/Ok_Design6972](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Design6972/)
By mail : contact@yuekai.fr
I also recommend asking your question directly in the Reddit forums to get responses from other enthusiasts: https://www.reddit.com/r/BMCU/.

> Please never hot-plug the cable between the BMCU and the printer, I have already fried my BMCU and printer 🥶. More details on : [BMCU-accident-hot-swapping](/BMCU/BMCU-accident-hot-swapping)
> 15/04/2025 A Chinese dude burned out his AMSL when connecting AMSL and BMCU at the same time and hotplugging the BMCU ..... So don't do that either.

> Update 5th May
> In firmware versions :
**01.08.00.00** for the **P series**
**01.09.00.00 (20250429)** for the **X series**
>
>Bambulab has added support for the updated AMS model like AMS 2, which involved changes to the communication protocol between the AMS system and the printer. 
>
>As a result, BMCU currently does not function properly (e.g., unable to modify filament settings). It is unclear how soon BMCU's author will respond to these changes. If you intend to keep your P/X printer updated with the latest firmware, we recommend not relying on BMCU at this time.
The **A-series** is not affected at the moment, according to Bambulab the adaptation programme for the newer AMS for the A-series is still a few months away.
