## Disclaimer

This disclaimer applies to BMCU related assembly and auxiliary services provided by me.

This sale is primarily intended to cover the costs of motherboard procurement, parts matching, assembly, testing, shipping and customs clearance, and is not a commercial mass production or volume profit sale.

The fee paid by the purchaser only covers the cost of the above services and I do not provide additional commercial support or warranty.

The BMCU is not an official AMS Lite product and is used at the purchaser's own risk.  
As the BMCU is a DIY device, there may be compatibility issues, firmware update limitations, or hardware maintenance requirements during the actual use of the BMCU, and the purchaser needs to have the appropriate technical skills.

The purchaser may not use the BMCU for commercial purposes, and all use is subject to the GPL2.0 open source licence.

For stability, functionality and official support, we recommend purchasing an official AMS Lite device for a more stable experience.
