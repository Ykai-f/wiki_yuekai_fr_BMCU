# PCB - Flashing - Connection



### Printer Cannot Recognize AMS, or Main Board Shows Red Light üö®

<details>
  <summary>Click to expend</summary>
After connecting to the printer the motherboard shows a red light meaning that the BMCU and printer communication is NOT established, however power is successfully supplied to the BMCU.
If you make your own molex 4 pin cable, check first if the AB wire sequence is wrong.

Then check for possible PCB issues, such as:
- Loose solder joints on components
- Faulty communication wiring (e.g., missing resistors in communication lines)
- Incorrect chip orientation or poor soldering causing virtual connections
  
  
Worst case scenario, the AMS connector board or printer motherboard is damaged. Or the 75176 chip on BMCU is damaged.
  
> You should not use the original AMS Lite 4Pin cable from Bambulab because the AMS Lite has the AB signals in the reverse order of the BMCU.

### Device Manager Cannot Detect MainBoard or Downloader (USB to TTL) 

<details>
  <summary>Click to expend</summary>
üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Steps

  #### Verify Downloader Recognition

First, connect the USB-to-TTL downloader alone to your computer (without connecting to the mainboard).

- If it appears as a serial device (e.g., COMx) in Device Manager, the driver is properly installed.
- If no device appears, install the CH340 USB-to-Serial driver (commonly used in many USB-TTL modules).

#### Check for Short Circuits on the Mainboard

If the downloader is detected when connected alone, but disappears or disconnects when attached to the mainboard, this often indicates a short circuit, typically between 3.3V and GND.

Carefully inspect the circuitry around the CH32V microcontroller for any solder bridges or damaged components.

#### Ensure Correct Wire Connections

Double-check the DuPont wire order: TX ‚Üî RX, RX ‚Üî TX, GND ‚Üî GND, and 3.3V.


#### Disable USB Port Protection (if applicable)

On some PCs, aggressive USB port protection or antivirus software may prevent the downloader from being recognized.

Try switching to another USB port or temporarily disabling port protection if you're familiar with your system's settings.

# Filament movement / Motor / Noise

### Filament Inserted, Indicator Light On, but Printer Doesn't Detect It

<details>
  <summary>Click to expend</summary>
  
  This may be due to the following reasons:

1. First, the magnet signal is missing, such as the magnet is forgotten to be installed or the AS5600 chip is faulty. In the absence of the magnet signal, the BMCU will not perform any operation to detect the consumables.
1. Second, other faults at the welding level, such as the CH32V chip or PH10 socket is not welded properly
  
  Solution:
  - Ensure the magnet is installed; 
  - After installing the magnet, restart the device for detection.
  - Check for loose PH2.0 socket connections or broken cables.  
</details>


### No filament Inserted, but System Shows Material Present (Or filament led keeps on) üìè
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

#### üß© Issue Description  
The system reports that filament is present even when no material has been inserted. This can manifest as:

- The filament detection indicator (LED) remaining **ON**
- In AMS menu display filament always present in a certain channel

---

#### üîç Cause  
This behavior is a **known limitation** of the BMCU design, which relies on an optical sensor aligned with a narrow structural hole. The sensor detects filament presence when the beam is interrupted.

False positives (i.e., filament always detected) may occur due to:

- Slight height inconsistency of the photoelectric sensor at the factory 
- Slight height inconsistency of the photoelectric sensor at the time of soldering 
- Shape deviation at the time of printing of the detection aperture 
- Debris or dust blocking the optical path

The steel ball version is designed to reduce the chance of this problem, but we have noticed that some users even with the steel ball version still encounter this situation.

---

#### ‚úÖ Why It Usually Doesn't Affect Printing  
This issue is generally **non-critical**. A false positive ‚Äî where filament is always reported as present ‚Äî is much less disruptive than a false negative, which might prematurely pause a print.

Additionally, the firmware includes a **secondary safeguard**:  
It monitors filament movement within the extruder. If no filament is actually being pushed through, the system will trigger a pause automatically, ensuring job protection.

---

#### üõ†Ô∏è Optional Improvements  
If you'd like to improve sensor reliability, you may consider:

- Gently cleaning the optical hole and slider using a precision tool to remove dust or filament residue  
- Slightly enlarging the detection hole with a micro drill bit (1.2‚ÄØmm recommended)  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è *Do not exceed 1.2‚ÄØmm*, or the sensor may incorrectly report "no filament" due to too easy for light passing through   
- Re-soldering or re-aligning the optical sensor if visibly misaligned  
- If you are using non-steel ball version, you can try upgrading -> need reprint almost everything and completely disassemble the BMG gear, and purchase additional parts
  
‚ö†Ô∏è Impact on Auto Refilling Function
This issue can negatively affect the auto refilling feature. For example:

- Suppose the filament detection on Channel 1 is faulty and always reports filament as present.
- You are about to run out of filament on Channel 1
- You have set up Channel 2 with the exact same material, expecting the printer to automatically refill from it.

However, when the filament on Channel 1 runs out, the printer may fail to recognize the absence correctly. As a result, it might trigger a filament jam error instead of recognizing a normal runout and switching to Channel 2.

If you're using the BMCU mainly for auto refilling purposes, we recommend the following setup:

- Connect the spool that is likely to run out to a channel where filament detection is working correctly in this exemple channel 2.
- Connect the backup spool (with enough material) to the channel affected by this issue in this case channel 1.

This setup will ensure that when the primary spool is depleted, the system can detect it accurately and trigger the refilling process as expected.

> üîß **Note:** Due to mechanical and manufacturing tolerances, this issue affects many BMCU units to some extent. In most cases, it does **not** impair normal printing operations.

### Material Feeds In and Then Retreats, Unable to Continue Feeding

<details>
  <summary>Click to expend</summary>
  Solution:
  This issue is often caused by:
  - Missing radial magnet
  - Magnet not rotating with the shaft and bmg gear

  üõ†Ô∏è Fixes:
  - Use a correctly sized and oriented radial magnet (6√ó2.5mm)
  - Check and ensure the AS5600 encoder chip is properly soldered
  - Make sure the magnets rotates sommthly and correctly.

</details>





### Feeder Motor Spins but Doesn't Feed Material Properly

<details>
  **For BMCU-A**:
  
  - Triangular gear may be too tight, preventing engagement.
  - Precision errors in external parts may cause jamming.  
  
  **For BMCU-B/C:**
  - The worm gear and the 182A gear may be worn, and you will have to replace the worm and gear.
	- The worm may not mesh properly with the gear. This is more likely to happen with the BMCU-C. In the early version of the BMCU-C model v0.2, the motor was located too far away from the gear set, making it very likely that the worm did not mesh properly with the gear. In this case, re-seat the motor and manually push it towards the gear while it is being fixed.
  
</details>


### Noise during feeding in particular BMCU-C

<details>
  <summary>Click to expend</summary>
  
  **For all the versionÔºö**
  - Check if screws are pressing against the motor shaft, causing friction.
  - Noise during feeding may be due to gear skipping, which is unavoidable.
  - Apply lubricant to reduce noise from misaligned gears.  
  
**For BMCU-C :**
  
We have observed that the Hall version is more prone to generating unexpected noise during the final stage of the feeding process. This typically manifests as follows:

- After the filament has been successfully inserted into the printer's tool head, the BMCU continues the feeding action for approximately 0.5 seconds, causing noticeably louder gear noise. The noise is from the BMG gear in the lever.
- During this phase, you may also notice that the buffer does not pop up, or does so with difficulty.
  
**Root Cause**
  
  The root cause of this issue is insufficient force to allow the buffer to pop up in time, which leads to the printer receiving the buffer arrival signal too late. Contributing factors include:

1. Inadequate tension from the lever spring
1. PTFE tube being too short, preventing the buffer from fully ejecting
1. Excessive bending angle of the PTFE tube, causing increased friction between the buffer and the BMCU housing
1. Potential firmware-related issues

**Recommended Solutions:**
  
1. Replace the lever spring ‚Äì The originally recommended 0.6√ó4√ó10 spring is now considered too weak. We recommend replacing it with a 0.6√ó4√ó15 spring for stronger rebound force.
1. Reposition the PTFE tube ‚Äì Ensure the tube is of appropriate length and angle to reduce friction and allow proper buffer movement.
1. Update to the latest 0013-Plus-Color-Noise-Heat-Improve firmware ‚Äì This firmware reduces motor gripping force during the feeding process.

**Final Notes:**
  
This issue has been reported by some users, while others have not experienced it. The root causes appear to be multifactorial and may vary between setups. Further improvements to this component may be made in future updates.

### AMS Lite Hub / 5-way pop up

![5_way_pop_up.gif](/assets/images/gif/5way_pop_up.gif =x300)

<details>
  <summary>Click to expend</summary>
  The root cause of this problem is that there is a large resistance in the path of the consumable exit, causing the entire PTEF tube to be pulled backwards.
  This issue occur more offen on BMCU-B, particularly when using older firmware versions.
  Using updated firmware or firmware versions with extended buffer lengths can significantly reduce the likelihood of encountering this problem.

  Solution:
  - Always check first if there is any particular resistance somewhere in the path of the consumables, e.g. large bending angles or PTFE tubes that are not smooth enough inside.
  - It is strongly recommended to upgrade the motherboard firmware to version 3.14 or later, which is more stable and reduces (but does not eliminate) the probability of this issue occurring.
  - If the issue persists, building an external buffer may further mitigate the problem. referce makersworld link : [Link 1](https://makerworld.com.cn/zh/models/1042461-bmcuwai-zhi-huan-chong?from=search#profileId-1076821) [Link 2](https://makerworld.com.cn/zh/models/1057356-29mmxing-cheng-wai-jie-huan-chong?from=search#profileId-1095144) [Link 3](https://makerworld.com.cn/zh/models/1144176-bmcu-370gang-zhu-ban-wai-zhi-huan-chong?from=search#profileId-1203810).
  - Additionally, verify whether the AMS Lite hub (five-way connector) is damaged ‚Äî especially the square-shaped locking clip. If damaged, this module may need to be replaced and reinstalled with the application of interface grease.
  - **Disabling** retraction during filament cutting may also help reduce the occurrence of this issue.

### Slicing Software Issues
<details>
  <summary>Click to expend</summary>
  
Some users have reported abnormal behavior after slicing with **BMCU**, such as:

- All channels being assigned the same color
- Inability to print using **AMS**

After investigation, this issue was identified as a problem with **Bambu Studio** itself.  
It affects both Windows and Mac versions:

- **Mac**: Versions prior to `2.0.0.95` may encounter this issue.
- **Windows**: Versions prior to `2.03.54` may encounter this issue.

**Recommendations:**

- Upgrade **Bambu Studio** to `2.0.0.95` or higher (Mac) and `2.03.54` or higher (Windows).
- Alternatively, using **Oracle Slicer** is another effective solution to avoid these problems.

### Single PTFE Tube Being Pulled Out
<details>
  <summary>Click to expend</summary>
  
Some users reported that a **single PTFE tube** was pulled out, instead of the entire **AMS Lite Hub** being ejected.

**Recommendations:**

- Always check for any abnormal resistance when loading/unloading filaments.
- Ensure that the **metal clip** of the **AMS Lite Hub** properly secures the PTFE tube.
- One user, **David**, reported frequent occurrences on a specific filament channel. After disabling the `Long Retraction During Cut` option, he observed significant improvement for that filament channel.
