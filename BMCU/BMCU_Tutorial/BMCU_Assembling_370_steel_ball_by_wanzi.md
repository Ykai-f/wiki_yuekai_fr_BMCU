# 370 Steel Ball Version Assembly Guide

This tutorial is made by `@丸子`

## Introduction

This guide covers the assembly of the 3-14 version of the 370 Steel Ball model. It is also generally applicable to other steel ball versions.

## Preparation Before Assembly

You will need a fully soldered BMCU circuit board. Please ensure there are no soldering defects such as cold joints, missed spots, solder bridges, or incorrect connections.

The firmware must be flashed before assembly. For the flashing guide, please refer to the group files.

Use firmware version **3-14**, which supports both **A series** and **P series**.

### Assembling the 182A Gear and 2x20 Shaft

Press the shaft into the gear as shown, ensuring equal lengths extend from both sides.

![Install Shaft to 182A Gear](/assets/images/build-370/components/给182a齿轮装轴.jpg =x350)

---

### Installing the Worm Gear on the 370 Motor

For **Jiali motors**, press the worm gear all the way down. The length should align perfectly.

---

### Assembling the Buffer Unit

Combine the **Slider Post** and the **Slider**.

![Buffer Assembly Step 1](/assets/images/build-370/components/组装缓冲-1.jpg =x350)
![Buffer Assembly Step 2](/assets/images/build-370/components/组装缓冲-2.jpg =x350)

Slide the **0.6*12x30mm spring** over the buffer unit and place it into the **back cover**.

![Buffer Assembly Step 3](/assets/images/build-370/components/组装缓冲-3.jpg =x350)

Ensure the spring hooks onto the edge of the back cover.

![Buffer Assembly Step 4](/assets/images/build-370/components/组装缓冲-4.jpg =x350)

---

### Installing the Motor and Gear

Place the motor and the gear into the back cover.

![Insert Motor and Gear](/assets/images/build-370/components/把电机和齿轮放入后盖.jpg =x350)

Use a screwdriver through the bottom hole and secure the 370 motor with an **M3x5 flathead screw**.

![Secure 370 Motor](/assets/images/build-370/components/固定370电机.jpg =x350)

---

### Installing the Filament Break Detection Section

Place the **steel ball** into the back cover.

![Insert Steel Ball](/assets/images/build-370/components/把钢珠放入后盖.jpg =x350)

Then insert the **steel ball slider**.

---

### Installing the Hex Nut

In version 3-14, self-tapping holes are replaced with nuts to prevent thread wear from frequent disassembly.

Insert the **hex nut** into the back cover.

![Insert Hex Nut](/assets/images/build-370/components/把六角螺母放入后盖.jpg =x350)

Secure it with the **nut insert**.

![Insert Nut Plug](/assets/images/build-370/components/放入螺母塞.jpg =x350)
![Nut Plug Installed](/assets/images/build-370/components/把螺母塞安装到位.jpg =x350)

---

### Assembling the BMG Drive Gear

These are all the parts included in the BMG gear set:

![BMG Gear Set](/assets/images/build-370/components/BMG齿轮套装.jpg =x350)

Take one **D5x22mm shaft** and two **MR85ZZ bearings**. Press the shaft into one bearing until flush.

::: danger Important
Apply even force during installation. Install the shaft vertically to avoid damaging the bearing. Check shaft precision before use—some may not be perfect.
:::

![BMG Drive Gear Step 2 - Bearing In Place](/assets/images/build-370/components/组装bmg主动轮-2-底部轴承安装到位.jpg =x350)

Place the **BMG gear with set screw hole** as shown:

![BMG Drive Gear Step 3 - Insert BMG Gear](/assets/images/build-370/components/组装bmg主动轮-3-bmg.jpg =x350)

Insert the **set screw** using a hex key.

![BMG Drive Gear Step 4 - Set Screw](/assets/images/build-370/components/组装bmg主动轮-4-顶丝.jpg =x350)

Install the **top bearing**, ensuring it sits flush against the gear.

![BMG Drive Gear Step 5 - Top Bearing](/assets/images/build-370/components/组装bmg主动轮-5-顶部轴承.jpg =x350)
![BMG Drive Gear Step 6 - Completed](/assets/images/build-370/components/组装bmg主动轮-6-完成.jpg =x350)

Place the assembled **BMG drive gear** into the back cover, gear facing upward.

![Insert BMG Drive Gear](/assets/images/build-370/components/把bmg主动轮放入后盖.jpg =x350)

---

### Assembling the BMG Idler Gear

Insert two **needle bearings** into the **idler gear (no set screw hole)**.

![Idler Gear Step 1 - Insert Needle Bearings](/assets/images/build-370/components/组装bmg从动轮-1-放入滚针轴承.jpg =x350)

Place it into the **lever**, making sure the direction is correct, and insert the shaft from the BMG kit.

![Idler Gear Step 2 - Insert into Lever](/assets/images/build-370/components/组装bmg从动轮-2-放入扳手-插入轴.jpg =x350)

---

### Lubricating the Gears

I used "Tiger Head" hinge and slideway grease. **Do not use oil**—only grease.

![Apply Grease](/assets/images/build-370/components/给齿轮上润滑.jpg =x350)

---

### Insert the Steel Ball Spring

![Insert Steel Ball Spring](/assets/images/build-370/components/放入钢珠弹簧.jpg =x350)

---

### Closing the Middle Frame

![Close the Middle Frame](/assets/images/build-370/components/合上中框.jpg =x350)

Secure the middle frame with **M2x8 screws**.

![Secure Middle Frame](/assets/images/build-370/components/用螺丝固定中框.jpg =x350)

---

### Installing the Lever

Place the **lever** into the assembly and insert a **0.6*4x10mm spring**.

![Lever Installation - Spring](/assets/images/build-370/components/安装扳手-1-弹簧.jpg =x350)

Press the lever down and insert a **2x20 shaft** to lock it in place.

![Lever Installation - Shaft](/assets/images/build-370/components/安装扳手-2-轴.jpg =x350)

---

### Installing the Pneumatic Connector on the Buffer

Screw the connector into the buffer.

![Install Pneumatic Connector](/assets/images/build-370/components/安装缓冲器气动接头.jpg =x350)

---

### Installing the Radial Magnet

Place the radial magnet into the slot on the middle frame. Ensure it sits slightly below the surface.

*(Illustration borrowed from the 370X version, but it's the same process)*

![Install Magnet](/assets/images/build-370/components/安装磁铁-偷的图.jpg =x350)

#### How to Identify Radial vs. Axial Magnets

Radial magnets have stronger side pull and can spin freely when held sideways.

![Radial Magnet Example](/assets/images/build-370/components/径向磁铁.jpg =x350)


> At this stage, insert filament and power the motor with 12V~24V to test:
> - Can it pull filament?
> - Does the magnet spin correctly?
> - Does the grease distribute evenly?



> You can insert an optical fiber into the small hole next to the buffer as a light guide.

## Installing the Circuit Board and Final Testing

### Assembly

- Place the **secondary board** (sensor side down) onto the middle frame and secure with **two M2x8 screws**.
- Attach the **front cover** with **four M2x8 screws**.
- Connect the secondary board to the main board via ribbon cable.
- Connect the main board to your computer using a USB-to-TTL module (power and ground are enough). You can also wire it the same as during firmware flashing.

### Testing

> My pictures show the fully assembled unit, but I recommend testing after building one channel to avoid unnecessary trouble.

Initial power-up status (main board not shown, red LED on main board):

> Secondary board WS2812 red, buffer light ON, filament sensor OFF

![Test - Initial State](/assets/images/build-370/components/测试-原始状态.jpg =x350)

Press the lever, insert filament, then release:

> Secondary board WS2812 red, buffer light ON, filament sensor ON

![Test - Insert Filament](/assets/images/build-370/components/测试-插入耗材丝.jpg =x350)

Now pull the buffer open:

> Secondary board WS2812 red, buffer light OFF, filament sensor ON

![Test - Pull Buffer](/assets/images/build-370/components/测试-拉开缓冲器.jpg =x350)

## Installing the Feeding Assembly and Circuit Board to the Base

Very simple—refer to the image below:

![Install to Base](/assets/images/build-370/底座安装.jpg =x350)

- Secure the main board with **three M2x8 self-tapping screws**.
- Use **four M2x8 screws** to secure the main board cover.
- Fix the feeding assembly to the base using **M3x14 flathead screws**.
