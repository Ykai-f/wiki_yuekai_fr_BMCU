# FAQ
### 1. Is BMCU an official product from Bambulab?
No, BMCU is an open-source DIY project developed by a Chinese developer, 4061N.

### 2. Will Bambulab ban the use of BMCU?
There is no guarantee, and future compatibility depends on Bambulab's policies and updates.
> Currently a user has accidentally triggered the `"Unauthorised AMS system"` error on the `H2D`+`AMS2 PRO` combination, even though he is using the official devices.
This means that Bambulab may be using an encryption programme on the newer device.
So in the worst case, it may be necessary to keep the BMCU available by **not upgrading** the printer's firmware

### 3. What 3D printers does BMCU support?
BMCU natively supports Bambulab A Series printers as reconized as AMS Lite. 
Additionally, with extra DIY modifications, it can be adapted to work with the Bambulab P Series and potentially other brands with community-driven adaptations.

### 4. What is the difference between BMCU and the original AMS Lite?
in terms of functionality，the main difference is that BMCU does not support RFID recognition.

### 5. Should I get the 130/180 version or the 370 version?


| Feature              | 130/180 Version                           | 370 Version                               |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Feeding Mechanism** | Passive feeding; remains quiet and stable as long as there is no resistance in filament feeding. | Active feeding; periodically pushes filament to the printer, which may generate some noise. However, many users report it is still quiet. |
| **Noise Level**       | Generally quieter. Some noise during filament loading and unloading. | Potentially noisier due to active feeding, but user feedback indicates it is still relatively quiet. |
| **Filament Loading/Unloading Speed** | Slower loading and unloading. With some noise. | Very fast loading and unloading but produces noticeable noise. |
| **Assembly Difficulty** | Slightly more complex to assemble. | Easier to assemble. |
| **Maintenance** | Risk of clutch wear over time. | Risk of cleaning of the filament hole. If using metal gears, may generate more black grease residue. |
| **Disadvantages & Issues** | If not installed properly, it may cause the printer to get stuck at 99% after printing, continuously flushing material. | May push up the printer's five-way connector and could cause filament grinding, leading to clogging issues. |


Version 130 is structurally complex and requires more hands-on skills. However, as the model improves, the current 130 version is very stable.
Version 370 is not yet fully in the official version and is still in the process of iteration.

The prevailing view at the moment is that the 130 version is better, but the 370 version is the future. The next author's offcial version will be still 370 version's variant.

I do not offer any recommendations here.

### 6. Should I get the metal gear version?
According to other developers, metal gears do not provide better performance.and may further lead to ‘chewing’ problems.
Metal gears may reduce the risk of gears wearing into each other.

(Metal gears are very expensive and difficult to install on motors)

At present, all-metal gears are not fully recommended. Metal gears will have unavoidable wear and tear during initial use, which may result in the production of black oily substances such as metal shavings and lubricating oil mixing, causing maintenance.

Metal worm gears are recommended but they are very difficult to fit, the motor shaft is 2mm and usually the worm has an internal diameter of 1.95mm - 2mm, you may need to heat the worm to complete the interference fit.

I do not offer any recommendations here.
