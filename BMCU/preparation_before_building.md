# BMCU Required Tools List

| Name                                | Required | Description |
|-------------------------------------|----------|-------------|
| Soldering Iron (Knife Tip) + Solder Wire + Flux + Tweezers | Required | Used for soldering BMCU circuits. An adjustable temperature soldering station is recommended. |
| Heating Table / Hot Air Gun + Solder Paste + Stencil | Optional | Since PCB pins are dense, these tools are recommended for easier soldering. |
| 3D Printer | Required | If you're making a BMCU, you likely already have a 3D printer xD |
| PETG Filament | Recommended | Compared to PLA, PETG is more durable for printing the structure. Highly recommended. |
| Transparent  Filament | Required | For insertion into photoelectric vias for light guiding, Transparent PETG are preferred because of their higher opacity. You only need a little bit, so you may not need to buy 1kg. |
| Phillips Screwdriver | Required |A 3mm screwdriver is recommended. |
| Utility Knife / Craft Knife | Optional | Might have unexpected uses, such as clearing holes for optical sensors. |
| Electric Drill / Rotary Tool | Required | Used for correcting misaligned holes in printed parts. |
