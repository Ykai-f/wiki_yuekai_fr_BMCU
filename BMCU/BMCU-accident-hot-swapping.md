# ⚠️ My Accident - A Serious Warning to All Users ⚠️

## ❗ NEVER Hot-Swap the BMCU Connection ❗
Again **DO NOT hot-swap (disconnect or reconnect while powered on) the connection** between the BMCU and the printer.
Doing so **may cause irreversible damage** to both the BMCU and the printer.  
Sadly, I lost one of my BMCUs and the printer's motherboard due to this mistake.

## Incident Summary
During a recent round of BMCU testing, I unfortunately forgot this crucial precaution.  
I performed a **hot-swap** between the BMCU mainboard and the **Molex 4-pin connector** while the printer was powered on.

### Consequences:
- My **BMCU mainboard** was **completely destroyed** (A spectacular "firework" moment).
- Initially, I suspected the AMS connection board on the A1 was damaged.
- After consulting the official Wiki and further investigation, it was confirmed that the **printer’s mainboard itself was damaged**.

## Symptoms After Failure
- The printer's other functions may still work normally.
- The AMS interface may stop providing **24V power**.
- The AMS interface may fail to recognize the **AMSL system** or any connected **BMCU**.



## ⚠️ Root Cause Analysis
This issue is primarily related to the design of the **Molex 4-pin connector** used by Bambu Lab. Additionally, the BMCU mainboard lacks adequate protection against such incidents.

During a hot-swap, electrical arcing (tip discharge) may occur, causing 24V to be unintentionally applied to circuits designed for 3.3V operation. This overvoltage instantly damages the control chip and the printer's mainboard.

The official AMSL from Bambulab seems to have the same problem, a few users in China have experienced AMSL failures due to hot swaping.

> *This is a rare but real risk. the author is currently designing a new BMCU board with improved protection to prevent this failure mode.*


## 🤔 Am I at Risk?
Currently, the number of users affected by this issue is very small.  
(In fact, I had hot-swapped many times before without issues and even doubted the importance of this warning... until this happened.)  

If you have accidentally hot-swapped your BMCU before, **don't panic** — your system may still be fine. Just be aware of the risk and avoid doing it again in the future.


## Solution / Recovery Plan
If you encounter this issue, follow the **official Wiki diagnostic guide** to check:
- Is it the **AMS connection board** that's damaged?
- Or is the **printer's mainboard** damaged?

### Warranty Advice:
- **If your printer is still under warranty:** Contact Bambu Lab for support. (It might be safer not to mention the use of third-party devices through the AMS interface.)
- **If out of warranty:** Screwed...

If you are an A1 user and your warranty has expired, and if you have made any purchases from me before, and you confirm that it is your AMS connection board that is damaged, you can get an A1 AMS connection board from me for free (shipping fee not included).

## ✅ Recommendations
- **ALWAYS power off the printer completely** before connecting or disconnecting the BMCU.
- Label the BMCU connection with a clear warning:  
  `⚠️ DO NOT HOT-SWAP ⚠️`
